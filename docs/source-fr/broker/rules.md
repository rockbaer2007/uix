description: Match UIX Broker interactions against elements, captured data, and browser identity.

# Rules

Every interaction rule must match before Broker runs its directives. Rules use the interaction anchor by default, but can also specify a relative or absolute override anchor.

For non-`block` interactions, UIX Broker retries a missing rule override anchor every 50 ms for up to two seconds. This is useful for interfaces, such as dialogs, that mount after their initiating event fires.

## Host-element rules

Compact string rules use [UIX host-element path](../concepts/dom.md#hostelement-path-selection) matching against the interaction anchor or an override anchor.

`Tag`, `class`, `id`, `attribute`, and `property` selectors are supported.

Compact rules match against the interaction anchor, allowing for terse one-line rule definitions.

The rule list below matches when the interaction anchor:

- is `ha-button.action-button[data-action]`;
- has an object property `config.entity` that equals `light.example`;
- has an object property `controller` that is present but `undefined`; and
- does not have the object property `uixBrokerGuard`.

```yaml
rules:
  - "ha-button.action-button[data-action]"
  - "{.config.entity=light.example}"
  - "{.controller=undefined}"
  - "{!.uixBrokerGuard}"
```

Use the expanded form when a rule must inspect a different anchor element. Its `anchor` config selects the element to test, and its `match` applies [UIX host-element path](../concepts/dom.md#hostelement-path-selection) matching to that selected element. A rule `anchor` is relative to the interaction anchor; prefix it with `&` for an absolute document root `select_tree` path. The expanded `select_tree` form is also available and is always absolute to the document root.

```yaml
rules:
  # Relative rule anchor with a tag match
  - anchor: "$ ha-dialog"
    match: "ha-dialog"

  # Compact absolute rule anchor with a tag match
  - anchor: "&home-assistant $$ ha-automation-sidebar"
    match: "ha-automation-sidebar"

  # Long absolute rule anchor with a host-element object property match
  - anchor:
      select_tree: "home-assistant $$ ha-automation-sidebar"
    match: "{._yamlMode=false}"
```

!!! tip
    Rule anchors use the same [select-tree syntax](./interaction-anchors.md#select-tree-anchors) as directive anchors and are retried while a non-`block` interaction is running.

!!! tip
    Host-element object property match `{.property=undefined}` matches only when the property exists and its value is `undefined`. `{!.property}` matches only when the property is absent.

## Typed rules

Typed rules have a `type` key. The supported types are `browserid`, `user`, `user_is_admin`, `hash`, `search`, `captured`, and `panel`.

### Browser identity

The `browserid` rule matches a [Browser Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) browser id. Use the key `id`, `browser_id`, or `value` for the expected browser identity.

```yaml
rules:
  - type: browserid
    id: kitchen-tablet
```

### Home Assistant user

!!! info
    Home Assistant user rules available in 8.3.0-beta.1

Use `type: user` to match the signed-in Home Assistant user by either their
display name (`hass.user.name`) or stable user id (`hass.user.id`). Home
Assistant usernames are not available in the frontend user object and are not
supported by this rule; use a display name or id. `match` and `value` use the
same matching syntax and operators as [captured-data rules](#captured-data-rules),
including wildcards, regular expressions, and boolean composition. Set either
`match` or `value`.

```yaml
rules:
  # Matches a user named Darryn or whose id is Darryn.
  - type: user
    match: Darryn

  # Prefer the stable id when it is known.
  - type: user
    match: 9f1362c9e0a24d918c66d4fdcf12b001
```

For a positive matcher, either the name or id may match. A negated matcher,
including `not` or `!=`, must exclude both fields. For example, this matches
every user except the user named `wall-panel` (or with that id):

```yaml
rules:
  - type: user
    match:
      not: wall-panel
```

Use `type: user_is_admin` to match the current user's administrator status.
With no matcher it means “is an admin”; set `match` or `value` to `false` for
non-admin users. It supports the same advanced matcher objects.

Admin user:

    rules:
      - type: user_is_admin

Non-admin user whose name or id starts with wall-:

    rules:
      - type: user
        match: wall-*
      - type: user_is_admin
        match: false

### Browser URL fragment

Use `type: hash` to match the browser URL fragment. The value is the portion after `#`, so no `path` is required. `match` and `value` use the same matching syntax and operators as [captured-data rules](#captured-data-rules).

```yaml
rules:
  - type: hash
    match: settings
```

This rule prevents the interaction's directives from running unless the current URL ends with `#settings`.

### Browser search parameters

Use `type: search` to match a named URL search parameter. Set `path` to the parameter name. `match` and `value` use the same matching syntax and operators as [captured-data rules](#captured-data-rules).

```yaml
rules:
  - type: search
    path: entity_id
    match: "light.kitchen*"
```

This rule prevents the interaction's directives from running unless the URL has a matching `?entity_id=` parameter. Use `exists: false` to match when the named parameter is absent.

## Captured-data rules

Use `type: captured` to match data collected from the initiating event. `path` is a dot-separated optional-chaining path relative to captured data; do not start it with `@captured`. Array indexes can use dot notation (`items.0`) or brackets (`items[0]`). Use quoted bracket keys when a property contains punctuation, for example `settings['icon-color']`.

For browser and shortcut interactions, captured data starts at the DOM event's `detail`. For server interactions, Home Assistant event data is under `data`. Array indexes are supported.

```yaml
rules:
  - type: captured
    path: data.new_state.state
    match:
      operator: ">="
      value: 20
```

Simple match values support exact values, wildcards, regular expressions, and numeric comparisons:

```yaml
rules:
  - type: captured
    path: button
    match: "save*"
  - type: captured
    path: room
    match: "/^kitchen/i"
  - type: captured
    path: count
    match: ">= 20"
```

### Advanced matching

A matcher object supports `operator`, `value` (or `match`), `ignore_case`, `exists`, and nested `and`, `or`, and `not` compositions.

Supported operators are `>`, `<`, `=`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `contains`, `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `is_undefined`.

```yaml
rules:
  - type: captured
    path: button
    match:
      or:
        - "save*"
        - "/^submit$/i"
  - type: captured
    path: count
    match:
      and:
        - "> 0"
        - "<= 10"
  - type: captured
    path: data.value
    match:
      operator: is_undefined
      exists: true
```

`is_undefined` with `exists: true` distinguishes a present property whose value is `undefined` from a missing path. Use `exists: false` to explicitly match a missing path.

### Compact captured-data form

For compact configurations, map one or more captured paths directly in an object rule. Every entry must match. The `@captured` prefix is retained only in this compact form.

```yaml
rules:
  - "@captured.user.role": admin
    "@captured.enabled": true
```

## Panel rules

Use `type: panel` to match the current UIX panel object. UIX Broker obtains this object asynchronously; it contains the same `panel` fields available to [templates](../using/templates.md), such as `fullUrlPath`, `panelUrlPath`, `viewUrlPath`, and `panelComponentName`.

`path` (or its `property` alias) is a dot-separated optional-chaining path relative to that panel object. `match` and `value` use exactly the same matching syntax and operators as [captured-data rules](#captured-data-rules), including wildcards, regular expressions, numeric comparisons, `exists`, and `and`/`or`/`not` composition.

```yaml
rules:
  - type: panel
    path: fullUrlPath
    match: "lovelace/kitchen*"
  - type: panel
    path: fullUrlPath
    match:
      operator: contains
      value: automation/edit
  - type: panel
    path: panelComponentName
    match:
      operator: "="
      value: lovelace
```

!!! warning
    Panel state is asynchronous. An interaction using a panel rule cannot use a `block` directive, because blocking an event must complete in the event's synchronous call stack. UIX Broker skips such interactions and logs a warning.
