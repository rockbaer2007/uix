# Themes

## Getting started

To get started, you need themes enabled in Home Assistant.

The best way to do this is to create a new /config/themes/ directory, and then add the following to your configuration.yaml

```yaml
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes/
```

After restarting Home Assistant, you can place theme files in that directory, load them with the Frontend [reload_theme](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/frontend/#setting-themes) service.

Theme files are normally yaml documents, which contain settings for the many themeable variables available in Home Assistant.

`/config/themes/red.yaml`

```yaml
red-theme:
  primary-color: red
  ha-card-border-radius: 20px
```

!!! tip "Theme name"
    The theme name must be on the first row, and the rest should be indented one level.

![Red theme example](../assets/page-assets/using/theme-red.png){ width="500" }

## Basic UIX theme

!!! info "Theme variable"
    The theme MUST define a `uix-theme` variable whose value selects the theme
    definition UIX uses for UIX styles and macros. `uix-theme` normally matches the Home
    Assistant theme name, but may point to another theme when you want to reuse
    its UIX configuration.

    `uix-theme` matching Home Assistant theme.
    
    ```yaml
    my-awesome-theme:
      uix-theme: my-awesome-theme

      ... UIX theme variables, styles, macros go here ...
    ```

    `uix-theme` pointing to another theme.

    ```yaml
    theme-mods:
      ... UIX theme variables, styles, macros go here ...
    
    my-awesome-theme:
      uix-theme: theme-mods
    ```

`/config/themes/red.yaml`

```yaml
red-theme:
  uix-theme: red-theme # this variable must match a valid Home Assistant theme name including case

  primary-color: red
  primary-text-color: white
  ha-card-border-radius: 20
```

Once `uix-theme` is set, we're ready to do some really powerful things.

To apply the basic functionality of UIX globally, you can use the `uix-<thing>` variables, where `<thing>` is any [theme variable](#theme-variables).

For example, say you want a border around every row in an entities card, you may do something like the following.

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: light.bed_light
    style: |
      :host {
        display: block;
        border: 1px solid black;
      }
  - entity: light.ceiling_lights
    uix:
      style: |
        :host {
          display: block;
          border: 1px solid black;
        }
  - entity: light.kitchen_lights
    uix:
      style: |
        :host {
          display: block;
          border: 1px solid black;
        }
```

This can now be added to our theme instead.

```yaml
red-theme:
  uix-theme: red-theme
  ...
  uix-row: |
    :host {
      display: block;
      border: 1px solid black;
    }
```

![Red theme row border example](../assets/page-assets/using/theme-red-black-rows-border.png){ width="500" }

!!! tip "`uix-<thing>` variables"
    `uix-<thing>` variables contain strings containing CSS code, and must start with `|` or `>` and be indented at least one step.

Just like normal, you can use Jinja2 templating to process the styles.

```yaml
red-theme:
  uix-theme: red-theme
  ...
  uix-row: |
    :host {
      display: block;
      border: 1px solid {% if is_state(config.entity, 'on') %} red {% else %} black {% endif %};
    }
```

![Red theme with template row borders](../assets/page-assets/using/theme-red-red-rows-template.png){ width="500" }

## Classes

UIX lets you set a CSS class to elements. You can then use this in your theme.

```yaml
red-theme:
  uix-theme: red-theme
  ...
  uix-row: |
    ...
    :host(.teal) {
      background: teal;
    }
    :host(.purple) {
      background: purple;
    }
```

```yaml
type: entities
entities:
  - entity: light.bed_light
  - entity: light.ceiling_lights
    uix:
      class: teal
  - entity: light.kitchen_lights
    uix:
      class: purple
```

![Red theme with classes](../assets/page-assets/using/theme-red-classes.png){ width="500" }

## Navigating the shadow DOM

Just like with UIX styles applied to a card, you can traverse the shadow DOM structure of the thing you want to style. To do this, you need to specify the variable `uix-<thing>-yaml`, and then the syntax is exactly the same.

```yaml
red-theme:
  uix-theme: red-theme
  ...
  uix-row-yaml: |
    ...
    hui-generic-entity-row $ state-badge $: |
      @keyframes pulse {
        50% {
          opacity: 0.5;
        }
      }
      ha-state-icon {
        animation: pulse 2s infinite;
      }
```

!!! tip "Theme variables MUST be strings"
    While the value of the `uix-<thing>-yaml` variable is actually yaml, as far as the theme is concerned it MUST be a string, which in turn contains more strings.

## Local theme override with `uix.theme`

You can force one styled card/row/badge/element to use a different Home Assistant theme than the currently active global theme. `uix.theme` takes precedence over inherited/current theme for that UIX node.

Main red row theme:

```yaml
row-red:
  uix-theme: row-red
  uix-row-yaml: |
    hui-generic-entity-row $: |
      .info{
        color: red;
      }

```

Override blue row theme:

```yaml
row-blue-override:
  uix-theme: row-blue-override
  uix-row-yaml: |
    hui-generic-entity-row $: |
      .info{
        color: blue;
      }
```

Entities card with theme override for one row:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Lights
entities:
  - entity: light.bed_light
  - entity: light.ceiling_lights
  - entity: light.kitchen_lights
    uix:
      theme: row-blue-override
```

![UIX Theme override example](../assets/page-assets/using/theme-local-override.png){ width="500" }

!!! warning "Take caution where you use theme overrides"
    Styling and theming in Home Assistant can get quite complex. You may expect a CSS variable to apply and find it does not. For example, if you apply `--primary-text-color: color;` to an entities row either by direct UIX styling to `:host {}` or `uix.theme` override you may expect the entities text to be the color you have set to `--primary-text-color`. However in this case `color` style is set at the `ha-card` element of the entities card, so this override will have no effect.

## Updating `uix-<thing>` variable to `uix-<thing>-yaml` variable

!!! tip "UIX theme variable precedence"
    `uix-<thing>-yaml` always takes precedence over `uix-<thing>` which is NOT used if `uix-<thing>-yaml` is present in the theme.

As you develop your UIX themes you are likely to come to a point where you started with straight CSS strings with `uix-<thing>` but need to update to use `uix-<thing>-yaml`. You can do this by using the root yaml selector `.:`. Below is the full example of the red theme using `uix-row-yaml`.

```yaml
red-theme:
  uix-theme: red-theme # this variable must match a valid Home Assistant theme name including case

  primary-color: red
  ha-card-border-radius: 20px

  uix-row-yaml: |
    .: |
      :host {
        display: block;
        border: 1px solid {% if is_state(config.entity, 'on') %} red {% else %} black {% endif %};
      }
      :host(.teal) {
        background: teal;
      }
      :host(.purple) {
        background: purple;
      }
    hui-generic-entity-row $ state-badge $: |
      @keyframes pulse {
        50% {
          opacity: 0.5;
        }
      }
      ha-state-icon {
        animation: pulse 2s infinite;
      }
```

## Theme variables

- `uix-card`
- `uix-row`
- `uix-glance`
- `uix-badge`
- `uix-heading-badge`
- `uix-assist-chip`
- `uix-element`
- `uix-entity-marker`
- `uix-root`
- `uix-view`
- `uix-more-info`
- `uix-sidebar`
- `uix-config`
- `uix-panel-custom`
- `uix-top-app-bar-fixed`
- `uix-dialog`
- `uix-toast`
- `uix-grid-section`
- `uix-calendar`
- `uix-todo`
- `uix-history`
- `uix-states-history-charts`
- `uix-drawer`
- `uix-view-background`
- `uix-persistent-notification-item`

Also `<any variable>-yaml`.

## Dialogs

`uix-dialog` and `uix-dialog-yaml` apply to styles rooted in the dialog element of dialogs which may be `ha-dialog`, `ha-adaptive-dialog`, or `ha-drawer` (notification uses a dialog with an element using the drawer type). Dialogs will also have their class set to `type-<dialog-type>` where `<dialog-type>` will be the dialog element name with any `ha-` prefix stripped. e.g. UIX will append `type-dialog-box` to dialog boxes as used by alerts and other dialog boxes. The Home Assistant dialog manager places dialogs in the shadow root of the top `<home-assistant>` element. The active dialog will be the last child of the shadow root. To view what dialog you wish to target, review the last child of this shadow root node.

See UIX guide [Styling dialogs with UI eXtension](https://uix-guides.lf.technology/dialogs/2026/02/27/styling-dialogs.html).

## Macros

Themes can define reusable Jinja2 macros available to all cards that use the theme. Macros are specified under the `uix-macros-yaml` theme key as a YAML dictionary of macro definitions — see [Templates - Macros](templates.md#macros) for the full macro configuration reference.

```yaml
my-awesome-theme:
  uix-theme: my-awesome-theme

  uix-macros-yaml: |
    is_on:
      params:
        - entity_id
      returns: true
      template: "{%- do returns(is_state(entity_id, 'on')) -%}"
    badge_color:
      params:
        - entity_id
        - name: color_on
          default: "'var(--state-active-color)'"
        - name: color_off
          default: "'var(--state-inactive-color)'"
      template: "{{ color_on if is_on(entity_id) else color_off }}"
```

Badge example using theme macros with defaults for `badge_color()`:

```yaml
  badges:
    - type: entity
      entity: light.bed_light
      tap_action:
        action: toggle
      uix:
        style: |
          ha-badge {
            --badge-color: {{ badge_color(config.entity) }} !important;
          }
```

![Example using theme macros with defaults](../assets/page-assets/using/theme-macros-badge-1.gif)

Badge example using theme macros setting `color_on` named variable to `red` in the `badge_color()` macro:

```yaml
  badges:
    - type: entity
      entity: light.bed_light
      tap_action:
        action: toggle
      uix:
        style: |
          ha-badge {
            --badge-color: {{ badge_color(config.entity, color_on='red') }} !important;
          }
```

![Example using theme macros with defaults](../assets/page-assets/using/theme-macros-badge-2.gif)

Card-level `uix.macros` take precedence over theme macros of the same name.

!!! warning
    [Theme macros](#macros) are only available in UIX styling templates, not in UIX Forge element/forge templates.
    Use UIX Forge [Global foundries](../forge/foundries.md#global-foundries) to define `forge.macros` available globally or per `mold`.
