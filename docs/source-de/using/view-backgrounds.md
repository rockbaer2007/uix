# View Backgrounds

UIX can display a full-screen **camera stream**, **video**, or **image** as a background behind your Home Assistant dashboard views and config panels.  The background is controlled entirely through CSS variables set in your theme and supports Jinja2 templates, so you can switch sources per view without any custom code.

!!! info "How it works"
    The `ha-drawer` styling patch also controls the view background, which allows the feature to work in dashboard views *and* config panels.  Variables must be set on `:host` inside the `uix-drawer` theme key so they are readable via `getComputedStyle(ha-drawer)`.  Because `ha-drawer` persists across navigation, the background element is **reused** when navigating between views with the same  / video / image — no teardown/recreate cycle.

## CSS variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `--uix-view-background-camera-entity` | Camera entity ID — UIX renders a muted `ha-camera-stream` which manages all stream connection and any authentication. |
| `--uix-view-background-image-entity` | Any entity with `entity_picture` — UIX manages any URL authentication and renders a cover-sized background image |
| `--uix-view-background-video` | Plain video URL — UIX renders a `<video autoplay muted loop playsinline>` |
| `--uix-view-background-image` | Plain image URL — UIX renders a cover-sized CSS `background-image` |
| `--uix-view-background` | Full CSS `background` shorthand value — applied directly to the background div; user is responsible for `url()`, sizing, positioning, etc. |
| `--uix-view-background-cover` | `view` (default) or `full` — controls viewport coverage (see [below](#coverage-modes)) |
| `--uix-camera-position`| Camera background position keyword — `center` (default), `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right` |
| :camera:  `--uix-camera-zoom` | Scale factor — values greater than `1` zoom in, less than `1` zoom out. |
| :camera:  `--uix-camera-pan-x` | Horizontal shift.  Accepts any CSS length or percentage. Positive values move the stream right (showing more of the left side of the camera). |
| :camera:  `--uix-camera-pan-y` | Vertical shift.  Accepts any CSS length or percentage. Positive values move the stream down (showing more of the top of the camera). |

:camera: The camera CSS zoom and pan CSS variables can be set either on `:host` inside `uix-drawer` or inside `uix-view-background`. See [camera positioning](#camera-positioning) and [camera zoom and pan](#camera-zoom-and-pan).

**Priority order**: `camera-entity` → `image-entity` → `video` → `image` → `background`.  All five slots can be active simultaneously as independent layers.

!!! tip
    You don't need to include `url()` around any of the camera entity, image entity, video or image CSS variables to use view backgrounds. `url()` will be added if and when required. You **DO** need to provide if you are using `--uix-view-background`.

## Coverage modes

The `--uix-view-background-cover` variable controls how much of the viewport the background fills.

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `view` *(default)* | Background fills only the **content area** — offset below the top bar (`--header-height`) and to the right of the sidebar.  The offset adjusts automatically when the sidebar is resized or toggled. NOTE: For any config panels like developer tools which have double header height, the view will not compensate beyond `--header-height`. |
| `full` | Background fills the **entire viewport**, sitting behind the top bar and sidebar. |

## Basic examples

### Camera stream background

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
      --uix-view-background-cover: view;
    }
  uix-view-background: |
    :host { opacity: 0.7; }
```

### Video background

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-video: /local/background.mp4;
      --uix-view-background-cover: full;
    }
  uix-view-background: |
    :host { opacity: 0.5; }
```

### Image background

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-image: /local/background.jpg;
      --uix-view-background-cover: view;
    }
```

### Background shorthand

Use `--uix-view-background` when you need the full CSS `background` shorthand — gradients, multiple images, `url()` with sizing and positioning all in one value.  You are responsible for the complete value.

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background: url('/local/background.jpg') center / cover no-repeat;
      --uix-view-background-cover: full;
    }
```

Gradients work equally well:

```yaml
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0d1b2a 0%, #1b263b 100%);
    }
```

## Switching per view with templates

As the `uix-drawer` style supports Jinja2 templates and the `panel` template variable reflects the current view, you can switch the background source automatically:

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      {%- if panel.viewUrlPath == 'garage' -%}
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garage
      {%- elif panel.viewUrlPath == 'driveway' -%}
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.driveway
      {%- endif -%};
      --uix-view-background-cover: view;
    }
```

See [Templates](./templates.md) for full template variable documentation.

!!! tip "Use template debug to check variables"
    To check what `panel` variables are available for your template, you can use a template in your theme with UIX debug and a CSS comment. Look for `UIX: Template updated` in your Browser console and drill down to `variables` and then `panel`.
    ```yaml
    uix-drawer: |
      {# uix.debug #}
      {{ '/* testing */' }}
    ```

## Styling the background with `uix-view-background`

UIX styling for the view background is available using the theme variables `uix-view-background`.  This lets you style the background content using the `uix-view-background` theme key — exactly like any other UIX theme target.

Common uses include opacity, grayscale, blur, and brightness:

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
    }
  uix-view-background: |
    :host {
      opacity: 0.6;
      filter: grayscale(30%) blur(2px);
    }
```

If you wish to adjust position or other attributes of the view background you can adjust the host container display parameters and also the displayed element. The displayed element will be per the table below.

| Type | Element |
| - | - |
| Camera entity | `ha-camera-stream` |
| Entity image | `div.uix-bg-image` |
| Video | `video` |
| Image | `div.uix-bg-image` |
| Background shorthand | `div.uix-bg-image` |

### Camera positioning

Camera backgrounds are **centred by default** — the stream fills the container and any aspect-ratio overflow is clipped symmetrically on all sides.  Use `--uix-camera-position` to change where the stream is anchored when it overflows:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `center` *(default)* | Centred horizontally and vertically |
| `top` | Anchored to the top edge |
| `bottom` | Anchored to the bottom edge |
| `left` | Anchored to the left edge |
| `right` | Anchored to the right edge |
| `top-left` | Anchored to the top-left corner |
| `top-right` | Anchored to the top-right corner |
| `bottom-left` | Anchored to the bottom-left corner |
| `bottom-right` | Anchored to the bottom-right corner |

```yaml
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
      --uix-camera-position: top;
    }
```

### Camera zoom and pan

UIX injects a default transform rule into every camera background so that you can zoom and pan the stream by setting CSS custom properties.  The variables can be set in **`uix-drawer`** (alongside `--uix-view-background-camera-entity`, for convenience) or in **`uix-view-background`** (for more targeted control).  When set in both places the `uix-drawer` value takes precedence.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--uix-camera-zoom` | `1` | Scale factor — values greater than `1` zoom in, less than `1` zoom out. |
| `--uix-camera-pan-x` | `0%` | Horizontal shift.  Accepts any CSS length or percentage. Positive values move the stream right (showing more of the left side of the camera). |
| `--uix-camera-pan-y` | `0%` | Vertical shift.  Accepts any CSS length or percentage. Positive values move the stream down (showing more of the top of the camera). |

**Centering**: `--uix-camera-position: center;` ensures zooming always scales from the centre of the stream — so the camera stays centred at every zoom level.  The pan variables shift from that centred position in screen space, independently of the current zoom level (10% pan is always a 10% screen-space shift).

**Everything in one place (position + zoom + camera entity in `uix-drawer`):**

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
      --uix-camera-position: center;
      --uix-camera-zoom: 1.5;
      --uix-camera-pan-x: -10%;
    }
```

**Zoom in and centre on the upper-left quadrant:**

At 2× zoom, the stream is twice the size of the container.  To bring the upper-left quadrant's centre into view, shift right and down by 50% of the container dimensions:

```yaml
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
      --uix-camera-zoom: 2;
      --uix-camera-pan-x: 50%;
      --uix-camera-pan-y: 50%;
    }
```

**Per-view zoom with templates:**

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
      {%- if panel.viewUrlPath == 'living-room' -%}
      --uix-camera-zoom: 1.8;
      --uix-camera-pan-x: -15%;
      {%- endif %}
    }
```

**Responsive zoom with media queries:**

CSS variables set inside a `@media` block apply only when that query matches, so you can zoom in on large screens while leaving the camera at natural size on smaller screens:

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
      /* No zoom on small / mobile screens */
      --uix-camera-zoom: 1;
    }
    /* Zoom in on large screens (≥ 1280 px wide) */
    @media (min-width: 1280px) {
      :host {
        --uix-camera-zoom: 1.4;
        --uix-camera-pan-y: -5%;
      }
    }
```

You can combine this with `--uix-camera-position` for screens of different proportions:

```yaml
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-camera-entity: camera.garden;
      /* Portrait / mobile: show the top of the feed */
      --uix-camera-position: top;
    }

    /* Landscape / desktop: centre the feed and zoom in slightly */
    @media (min-aspect-ratio: 16/9) {
      :host {
        --uix-camera-position: center;
        --uix-camera-zoom: 1.3;
      }
    }
```

### Customising image background CSS properties

Both **entity image** and **plain image** backgrounds render as a `<div class="uix-bg-image">`.  The div defaults to `background-size: cover; background-position: center; background-repeat: no-repeat`.  You can override any of these properties — or add new ones — via the `.uix-bg-image` selector:

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-image: /local/background.png;
    }
  uix-view-background: |
    :host { opacity: 0.8; }

    /* Tile the image instead of stretching it to cover */
    .uix-bg-image {
      background-size: 300px 300px !important;
      background-repeat: repeat !important;
      background-position: top left !important;
    }
```

## Making top app bar and sidebar transparent

You can use UIX styling on `uix-top-app-bar-fixed` to make the top app bar and sidebar transparent. Further config panels may have their own toolbars which you may also need to style via `uix-config`.

[Example](https://github.com/ngocjohn/hass-config/blob/40288532f57eacbbf9dd38b14f20b31ea615a9f5/config/themes/graphite-auto.yaml#L758-L768) as shared by `@ngocjohn` on Home Assistant Community Forum.

```yaml
  uix-top-app-bar-fixed: |
    :host {
      --mdc-top-app-bar-fixed-box-shadow: none;
      --sidebar-background-color: #ffffff00;
      --app-header-background-color: #ffffff00;
      --app-header-backdrop-filter: blur(2em);
      --app-header-border-bottom: none;
    }
```

## Loading spinner

While the media is loading UIX shows a CSS-only animated spinner centred on the background container.  The spinner fades out automatically once the media is ready (camera stream starts playing, video can play, or image has loaded).

The spinner can be customised via `uix-view-background` — it uses the class `.uix-spinner` (the track ring) and the pseudo-element `.uix-spinner::after` (the animated arc).

```yaml
my-theme:
  uix-theme: my-theme
  uix-drawer: |
    :host {
      --uix-view-background-image: /local/background.jpg;
    }
  uix-view-background: |
    :host { opacity: 0.7; }

    /* Make the spinner larger */
    .uix-spinner::after {
      width: 120px;
      height: 120px;
    }

    /* Change spinner colour to match your theme */
    .uix-spinner::after {
      border-color: rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.2);
      border-top-color: rgba(0, 128, 255, 0.9);
    }
```

## Tab visibility recovery

Browsers suspend WebRTC/HLS streams and video playback when a tab is in the background for a long time.  UIX automatically recreates camera stream and video elements when you return to the tab, recovering the stream or playback without any manual intervention.

Static image backgrounds are not affected.
